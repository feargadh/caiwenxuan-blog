      <p>Hey, I am Caiwenxuan, a web developer from China.</p>
      <p>
        This is my blog, recording some of problem, some of interesting demo or
        daily. I used to create blogs by{" "}
        <a href="https://vuepress.vuejs.org/zh/">Vuepress</a>,{" "}
        <a href="https://vitepress.dev/zh/">Vitepress</a> and{" "}
        <a href="https://docusaurus.io/">Docusaurus</a>, but I don't like their
        themes. Over time, I finally used{" "}
        <a href="https://nextjs.org/">Nextjs</a> to create this minimalist blog.
      </p>
      <p>
        I develop usually with{" "}
        <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</a>. In fact{" "}
        <a href="https://react.docschina.org/">React</a> and{" "}
        <a href="https://cn.vuejs.org/">Vue</a> both are just a tools for me,
        but I usually use React for working.
      </p>
      <p>
        programming is like playing games for me, so I am still a customized
        keyborad player at the same time. A good keyboadr can make me
        comfortable in programming, but they do take a lot of my money. Now I
        use{" "}
        <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1YH4y1y7KA/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0">

        at home, and{" "}
        <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ac41127QJ/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0">
          Keylice
        </a>{" "}
        in the company to programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope that the devolopment by me is meaningful, this meaning can be
        needed by somebody or can make moneny, but not that nobody uses it or it
        can't make moneny.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of programming, I enjoy playing games, doing photography and
        walking along.
